# Random-scripts
Some random scripts I made/use for various things 

#Deluge restart script (Raspberry Pi)
Deluge has a tendecy to crash after a few hours of using it, we need something to check if it's running and if not, restart it.

#TV Shows sorting script (Raspberry Pi)

Using RSS feed you can autodownload new Shows/Anime etc. This script (TV_Shows.sh) check a folder and if it has a name match move the file in the required directory. For those who seed it isn't suitable but you can include a timestamp before moving, let's say 1 day?
